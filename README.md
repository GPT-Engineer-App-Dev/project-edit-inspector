# project-edit-inspector

Create a new page at /project-data that will load and display the CSV data provided in the user's request. 

Parse the CSV data into an array of objects. Each object should have properties matching the CSV column names, like __path__, __id__, code_blocks, commit_sha, etc.

Display the parsed data in a simple list or table for now, to verify it is loading correctly. We will add filtering and formatting in the next steps.

Also add a link to the /project-data page from the homepage.
